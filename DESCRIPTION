Description: Provides string arithmetic, reassignment operators, logical operators
  that handle missing values, and extra logical operators such as floating point
  equality and all or nothing. The intent is to allow R users to write code that
  is easier to read, write, and maintain while providing a friendlier experience
  to new R users from other language backgrounds (such as 'Python') who are used
  to concepts such as x += 1 and 'foo' + 'bar'.
